===================

Linking author names to their profile pages, f.e. for Google's ```rel=author```

# User profile pages

This extension adds a new input field for an URL to the user form.

The news templates use this URL to link the author's name to the profile page.

# Adding author information in Google search results

By entering the URL to your Google+ profile page in the new field, followed by ```?rel=author```, Google will show your profile picture next to the Search Result, as well as a link to that profile.
